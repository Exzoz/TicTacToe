Tic Tac Toe
======
*by Faris & Tyler*

Welcome to the home of the forthcoming Tic Tac Toe game/project for COMP-330.

Currently, the "Tyler" branch contains Tyler's (unfinished) sample game, made in Processing. This is intended to serve as a demo of coding ability level to help the team work better together and will not be used or merged into the final project code.

## Tools and Languages used
- Game software written in Java (with alternate demo branch built in Procesing)
- GitHub used for version control

## Functional Requirements
### Requirements for Minimum Viable Product
- Allow 2 concurrent players simultaneously (take turns)
- Collect and display usernames for each player
- Display a game board
- Players take turns marking the game board with their token "x" or "o"
- Detect when one player or another reaches a victory condition as defined by the rules of Tic Tac Toe (link?) (also detect when the game is no longer winnable (tie/cat's game))
- Display the game status to the user at all times: whose turn it is, a scoreboard to keep track of wins, and messages letting players know about illegal moves or victories
- Board should be cleared after each game so that another game can be started
- User interface and game logic should be separate to the extent that one can be changed without impacting the other

### Stretch / Optional Requirements
- Allow user to customize their color and token (instead of X or O player could choose their own character or image to play)
- Help system easily accessible from any part of the program

## Non-functional Requirements
- Use GitHub for source control and issue / bug tracking
